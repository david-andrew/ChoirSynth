Tasks:
- downsample recording to 16000Hz -> verify sounds ok
- run sample through constant-q transform and back (try raw sample rate, and 16000) -> verify sounds ok


Notes:
- 16000Hz sounds perfect for piano
- probably cannot just directly use inverse constant Q transform. doesn't sound good, so will need to instead use the wavenet
